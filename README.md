# Newbies Guide to start Open Source Journey
This repo contains details about what skills to learn and how to start your journey in the Open source world!

## Common Skills:

It is important to note that you don't have to be a pro in all the technologies but some fundamental understanding will help you long way! :)
1. **Docker & Kubernetes:**

    - Docker is very helpful in running various project locally on your system. You can start the project without much hustle and can easily share work.

    - Kubernetes (K8s) is very heavily used in industry today to orchestrate and manage Docker containers. Majority of the project are containerized and managed by K8s. Therefore in order to contribute to these projects you need to have basic understanding of the architecture they run on.

2. **Git & Github:**

    - This one is obvious, I believe because without understanding how code sharing and collaboration is done, there is no way you can share you changes!
